    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        These soft-boiled, marinated eggs are perfect to add to your ramen soup. I was given this recipe by the owner of a great little ramen shop I stopped at for lunch one day. The eggs turn out beautifully every time.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
        
    <h3>Marinade:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese rice wine)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cooking sake</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Add ramen noodles and cook until tender, about 2 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a low boil.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                Carefully pierce the bottom of each egg with thumb tack. Gently lower eggs into the boiling water.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Step 4</h4>
                Gently lower eggs into water and boil for 6 minutes 20 seconds. Remove eggs and place in a bowl of ice water until completely cool, about 2 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Step 5</h4>
                While the eggs are cooling, stir together soy sauce, mirin, sake, and pepper for marinade in a bowl.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Step 6</h4>
                Carefully peel cooled eggs; try to start from the middle of the shell and work you way up and down.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Step 7</h4>
                Place whole peeled eggs in marinade. Refrigerate for at least 2 to 4 hours, or up to 2 days for stronger flavor, turning eggs every 30 minutes or as often as you prefer.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Step 8</h4>
                Slice eggs in half when ready to use.
            </li>
        </ul>
